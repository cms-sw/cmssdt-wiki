## [build-release](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/jenkins/job/build-release)

**Description:** This job actually builds a release.
It is triggered by cms-bot after the <a href="https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues?q=label%3Arelease-notes-requested">Release build Issue</a> is approved by the release manager.
<br/>
<ul>
  <li> In case the job fails:<br/>
Depending on the type of failure, most of the time re-try works. In some cases (specially for aarch64 builds), it fails due to disk quota issues 
as one of the aarch64 machine does not have enought disk. In that case, one needs to login to the corresponding aarch64 machine and cleanup old/unused stuff and then re-try this job.
  <li> In case there is a build error in a release:<br/>
It can happen that the job succeed, but there have been build errors that the bot reports in the corresponding issue.
    In this case, the <it>Rebuild</it> button can be used to re-trigger the build. The bot will automatically remove the build-error labels and inform that a new build has been started.
